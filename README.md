# Churn-Predictor
The purpose of this project is to use SQL to transform multiple datasets relating to customer phone calls over a four month period, to engineer new features, and to combine the datasets into a suitable case table in order to use Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a customer churning in any given month.
