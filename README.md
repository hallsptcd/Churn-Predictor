# Churn-Predictor

**Language**: SQL (Oracle SQL)

**Introduction**: The purpose of this project is to use SQL to transform multiple datasets relating to customer phone calls over a four month period, to engineer new features, and to combine the datasets into a suitable case table in order to use Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a customer churning in any given month.

**Data Files**: The datasets include *calls.csv*, *call_rates.csv*, *voicemails.csv*, *customer_service.csv*, *customers.csv*, *rate_types.csv*, *contract_plans*. The SQL files are SQLBuild.sql, SQLQueries.sql, and SQLML.sql.
